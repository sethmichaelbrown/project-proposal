Proposal A
  Build a website for my mom's company

    My mom runs a hearing aid company in Michigan. Her current website is...not great. Here's a link - http://www.riverfronthearing.com/. It's rough.

    One of the biggest challenges in this project would be keeping in mind the user base. Typically, hearing aid wearers are elderly which isn't to say innately tech-adverse, but there are certainly different needs. Additionally, my mom's company works with the United Auto Workers union almost exclusively so her customers are often more accustomed to building a car than traversing a website.

    With this in mind, my goal is to create a workable site that looks nice/ modern while taking into consideration that much of the information and usage has to be very straightforward.

Proposal B
  Build Out A Portfolio Site

    While I have rebuilt my personal website, it lacks a portfolio section, and feels pretty static/ non-responsive. To really build-in the mobile-first ideology, I would want to rebuild the site from scratch. Having a built-out portfolio will be a massive help in my job search after the program. One issue that comes to mind is that I don't currently have many high-res photos of my self. Seems like high-res photos are key to a nice looking site.
